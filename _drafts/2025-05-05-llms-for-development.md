title: LLMs For Development

### My Opinionated Take on LLMs for Development
Significant discourse has happened recently on using LLMs for development, writing, and otherwise. I would say there is a general apprehension to let LLMs fully take the wheel for development, and for good reason. If you just fall into a generate code -> error code -> generate code loop, there's a high likelihood of incorrect behavior especially on complex code bases. I'll address some of this apprehension before going into some ways that I believe LLMs are quite useful for development.

#### Avoiding LLMs Altogether:
I have spoken with a few people I respect who avoid using LLMs in general for development. The justification I hear is that you end up stifling your growth as a developer. I can certainly empathize with this take, as I do think that leaning on LLMs to do everything can reduce your decision making power over time. I would say to people with this take that there are ways to use LLMs such that it's not just writing all your code for you, where you are still in the drivers seat primarily, and this type of interaction can be quite useful. I'll go over a few of these here:

- **LLMs for Brainstorming Sessions**:
    - A valuable use of LLMs that I run into is for brainstorming sessions. I do not trust LLMs to be able to make design decisions for me, but I think that using LLMs to bounce ideas off of, and perhaps provide a wide variety of different strategies for you to then verify, gameplan, and implement.

- **Contextual understanding and learning**:
    - I believe access to quick answers for questions you might have within the context of a greater project is a great way to learn very quickly. For example, being able to ask questions about details of a particular code block. I go over this a bit [here](#cursor).

- **Syntax**
    - It can be a great way of getting quick access to syntax you might not be familiar with.
