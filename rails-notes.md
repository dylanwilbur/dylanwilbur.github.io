This is a collection of notes that I have on the [Ruby on Rails book by Michael Hartl](https://www.railstutorial.org/book). It is intended to supplement, not replace, the original book; it collects my thoughts about what I believe are the most notable takeaways, which can be used as a reference or for review.
